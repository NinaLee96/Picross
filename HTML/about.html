            I'm a Computer Science Student at Fresno State projected to finish in Spring semester of 2019. I enjoy learning new technologies and tools that
            I can utilize in programming. Over the past semesters I had the opportunity to do hands-on work with langauges like C++, Javascript, CSS,
            Python, Haskell, JQuery, PHP, HTML, and mySQL.
