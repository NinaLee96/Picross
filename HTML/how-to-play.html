    <h1>How to Play Nonogram</h1>

    <p>Nonogram is also known as Picross or Griddlers. Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid are
        colored or left blank depending on the hidden picture embedded in the grid.
        The grid contains numbers at the top of the grid and to the left of the grid, these numbers tell you if there
        are a group of consecutive black squares somewhere in that row or column.
        If there is more than one number in a row or column, it indicates that there are multiple groups of colored
        squares in that row or column separated by white spaces.
    </p>

    <p>In the example below, a 3 in a row or column means that somewhere in that row or column there is a colored block
        that can be revealed in the grid.
        If there are multiple numbers, that means there are multiple groups of colored blocks in the grid of that row
        or column separated by white spaces, as shown in the example
        below with 3 3 on the left side of the grid.
